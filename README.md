Topic: Guitar Tuner using MATLAB
Description: This project uses concepts in digital signal processing that were discussed in both the laboratory and lecture course. Topics such as Fast Fourier Transform were utilized to design and code a guitar tuner. This project also explores the other features and functions in MATLAB for audio processing, mainly for tuning. The MATLAB code consists of the standard frequencies of the guitar notes to be compared to the audio signal for tuning, the input audio signal, a filter, and FFT. The output should declare if the user should tune up or down depending on the sharpness or flatness of the sound. This will allow the user to adjust the tune for the string inserted into MATLAB. 
Features:
1. Input string sound clip for processing  
2. Filter the string sound clip to eliminate unwanted noise 
3. Use of FFT for the comparison of frequencies of the input audio signal to the frequency of the musical note 
4. Declare if note is too high (sharp) or too low (flat) for the desired musical note  
5. Has five (5) modes of tuning: standard, drop d, double drop d, dadgad, open d
